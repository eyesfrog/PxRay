# TinyRay
A physically based ray tracer in C++ on OSX.

## Introduce
The realistic ray tracer TinyRay is simple and crude.
It just has some basic functions and features such as BRDFs, Samplers, Cameras, Objects, Lights, etc.

More advanced functions and features are to be added.

## Gallery
Here's some pictures rendered by TinyRay.

Enjoy  :)

## About
This ray tracer is my personal practice on Computer Graphics. And it is implemented under the guidance of great books : _Ray Tracing From The Ground Up_ and _Physically Based Rendering_.

P.S. SDL is applied to display the picture, but strange bugs appear in OSX 10.11 El Capitan (or Xcode 7?) cause it can't works well. :(
