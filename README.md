# TinyRay
A physically based ray tracer in C++ on OSX.

## Introduce
The realistic ray tracer TinyRay is simple and crude.
It just has some basic functions and features such as BRDFs, Samplers, Cameras, Objects, Lights, etc.

More advanced functions and features are to be added.

This version is rebuilt with __Clion__.

## Gallery
Here's some pictures rendered by TinyRay.

Enjoy  :)

## About
This ray tracer is my personal practice on Computer Graphics. And it is implemented under the guidance of great books : _Ray Tracing From The Ground Up_ and _Physically Based Rendering_.
