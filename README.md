# PxRay
A physically based ray tracer in C++ on OSX.

## Introduce
The realistic ray tracer PxRay is simple and crude.
It just has some basic functions and features such as BRDFs, Samplers, Cameras, Objects, Lights, etc.

More advanced functions and features are to be added.

This version is rebuilt with __Clion__.

## Update
Add a new camera Fisheye.

## About
This ray tracer is my personal practice on Computer Graphics. And it is implemented under the guidance of great books : _Ray Tracing From The Ground Up_ and _Physically Based Rendering_.
